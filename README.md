# Energy-Market-Tools

This repository contains a collection of tools developed to assess the value proposition and potential market for distributed generation technology in residential, commercial and industrial markets in the United States.

It uses the DOE EIA API to download state level rate and consumption data, and then uses this data to estimate the potential state-level markets for distibuted generation technology given the performance, cost and utilization characteristics of such systems.
